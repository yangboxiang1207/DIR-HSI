DIR-HSI: Degradation-Invariant Representation Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification  
Abstract  
In recent years, Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification has achieved remarkable progress in fine-grained surface recognition and intelligent remote sensing analysis. However, real-world degradations—such as sensor noise, compression artifacts, and atmospheric interference—often introduce severe domain shifts, leading to degraded robustness and limited generalization of existing models. To address this challenge, we propose DIR-HSI, a degradation-invariant hyperspectral classification framework designed to enhance feature stability and discriminability under multi-degradation conditions. The framework comprises two key modules: the DIR-FFE (Degradation-Invariant Representation by Fourier-domain Feature Extraction) module, which leverages Fourier-domain feature decomposition to extract discriminative and degradation-insensitive frequency features, and the DIR-CE (Degradation-Invariant Representation Contrastive Enhancement) module, which employs cross-degradation supervised contrastive learning to enforce consistency among same-class representations across different degradation conditions. Together, these components enable effective disentanglement of degradation-sensitive and stable factors, maintaining feature consistency and reinforcing class separability. The key advantage of DIR-HSI lies in its ability to jointly model degradation-invariant and discriminative representations, achieving robust and generalizable performance across complex degradation scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that DIR-HSI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

Please create a new 'dataset' folder. Inside it, create a 'PaviaU' subfolder to store the PU data (two .mat files), and also create a 'noise_Pavia' subfolder to store the degradation data (.mat files).  
Please refer to HyperTTA (https://github.com/chenning0115/HyperTTA) for generating the relevant degradation files.
